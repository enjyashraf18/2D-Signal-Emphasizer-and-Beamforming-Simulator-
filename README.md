# Image Mixer
## Description
<div align="justify"> This desktop app is designed to allow users to manipulate and combine the Fourier Transform (FT) components of four input images. Users can adjust brightness and contrast, select specific FT components (magnitude, phase, real, and imaginary), and choose regions to include in the output. The mixing process involves calculating a weighted average of the FTs of the input images, with user-customizable weights for each image. The output is generated by applying an inverse Fourier Transform (ifft) to the mixed FT. The mixer also includes features for real-time updates and progress monitoring. If a user modifies mixing settings during an ongoing operation, the program will cancel the current operation and initiate a new one based on the updated settings.</div>
